## **XML Converter**

### ** Introduction** 
(For easy work everyday!)
- This tool is aimed to convert an xml file into other formats, e.g Excel and etc.
- For now, it is more like a XML splitter - it split a large size XML file into several small xml files based on structures(tags). 
- The source code is in the src file and the .jar file could be download with input folder, and double-click to run the converter. There are two test xml files in the input folder.
